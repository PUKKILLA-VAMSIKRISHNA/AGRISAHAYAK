# AgriSahayak Fixes Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat Form Not Working
**Problem**: The chat form had `onsubmit="return false;"` which prevented message submission.
**Fix**: Removed the `onsubmit="return false;"` attribute from the chat form.

### 2. Bootstrap Version Mismatch
**Problem**: CSS was using a custom Bootstrap theme while JS was using Bootstrap 5.3.0-alpha1, causing compatibility issues.
**Fix**: Updated both CSS and JS to use Bootstrap 5.3.0 and added custom dark theme CSS.

### 3. Voice Recognition Issues
**Problem**: Voice functionality had poor error handling and browser compatibility issues.
**Fix**: Added better error handling, null checks, and fallback mechanisms.

### 4. JavaScript Error Handling
**Problem**: `showNotification` function could fail if Bootstrap wasn't loaded properly.
**Fix**: Added fallback mechanisms and better error handling.
